Fun analyses of Magic the Gathering data
========================================

## Drafts from Draftsim

In 2018 I was lucky to get access to drafting logs from [Draftsim.com](http://draftsim.com) website, and have an opportunity to play with this data in R. Together with the rest of the team, we are now trying to write these analyses up as a series of blog posts. As of Sep 2018 we had published 2 posts:

1. [Basic analysis](https://draftsim.com/blog/draft-data-analysis/)
2. [Changes in drafting](https://draftsim.com/blog/m19-format-evolution/) early in the season, compared to late in the season

I thought that it could also be useful to post my R code online, with some comments and annotations. I don't necessarily think this code is innovative enough to be of note, but it took some time to troubleshoot it, and to build good visualization, and if you, dear reader, are interested in both R and MTG, you may actually enjoy it.

For now it is very much work in progress. The R notebook in R-Markdown format is shown above, and [here you can see it rendered in HTML](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/khakhalin/MTG/blob/master/draftsim_analysis.nb.html)

To be continued!
