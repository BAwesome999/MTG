Fun analyses of Magic the Gathering data

# Drafts from Draftsim

In 2018 I was lucky to get access to drafting logs from [Draftsim.com](http://draftsim.com) website, and had an opportunity to play with this data in R. Together, we are trying to write up these analysis as a series of blog posts. As of Sep 2018 we had 2 posts:

1. [Basic analysis](https://draftsim.com/blog/draft-data-analysis/)
2. [Changes in drafting](https://draftsim.com/blog/m19-format-evolution/) early in the season, compared to late in the season

I thought that it could be useful to post my R code online, with some comments and annotations. I don't think it is innovative in any way, but it took some time to troubleshoot it, and find good visualization, so if you, reader, are interested in both R and MTG, you may actually enjoy it.

For now it is very much work in progress, but [here are the first few paragraphs of an R notebook I'm slowly writing, rendered in HTML](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/khakhalin/MTG/blob/master/draftsim_analysis.nb.html)

To be continued!
