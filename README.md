R Analyses of Magic the Gathering data
========================================

## Drafts from Draftsim

In 2018 I was lucky to get access to drafting logs from [Draftsim.com](http://draftsim.com) site, and play with this data in R. Together with a team of two more people (Bobby Mills and Dan Troha) we wrote up these analyses as a series of blog posts. As of Sep 2018 we published 2 posts:

1. [Basic analysis](https://draftsim.com/blog/draft-data-analysis/)
2. [Changes in drafting](https://draftsim.com/blog/m19-format-evolution/) early in the season, compared to late in the season

I thought that it could also be useful to post my R code online, with some comments and annotations. I don't necessarily think this code is innovative enough to be of note, but it took me some time to troubleshoot it, and to build nice visualization, so if you, dear reader, are interested in both R and MTG, you may actually enjoy it. Here's what I've written so far:

* Basic analysis in R: [markdown notebook](draftsim_analysis.Rmd), and [the same thing rendered in HTML](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/khakhalin/MTG/blob/master/draftsim_analysis.nb.html) (with ggplot graphs and everything).

For now it is very much work in progress, but to be continued!
